# Spotify-Most-Streamed-2023
Based on kaggles "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023” dataset

The objective is to implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch using the ”Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023”. The dataset contains several features about songs in the Spotify library. Task is to predict a target variable using the features provided in the dataset. The target variable in this dataset could be the "streams" of the song, which represents the total number of streams on Spotify.

The model and other functions are developed without using ML libraries like sklearn, Pytorch or tensorflow.
